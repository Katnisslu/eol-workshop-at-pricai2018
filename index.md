## Introduction

Evolution and learning are two fundamental forms of adaptation. Recently, the interaction between  Evolutionary Computation (EC) and Machine Learning (ML) has received considerable attentions from both the academia and industry. The evolutionary optimization methods can be used in the training process of learning, e.g. optimizing the structure of DNNs, learning the representation, generating ensembles, finding the clusters, etc. The ML techniques can be employed in various ways in the process of evolutionary optimization, e.g. analyzing the evolutionary behaviors, learning the appropriate operators, reducing the evaluations, transferring knowledges from similar problems, and so on. Motivated by this, we are organizing a workshop around Evolutionary Optimization and Learning collocated with the 15th Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence August 27-31, 2018, Nanjing, China. The workshop will feature several keynote talks by leading experts on this topic and related fields.
