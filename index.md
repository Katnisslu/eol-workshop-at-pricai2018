### Introduction
Evolution and learning are two fundamental forms of adaptation. Recently, the interaction between Evolutionary Computation 
(EC) and Machine Learning (ML) has received considerable attentions from both the academia and industry. The evolutionary
optimization methods can be used in the training process of learning, e.g. optimizing the structure of DNNs, learning the
representation, generating ensembles, finding the clusters, etc. The ML techniques can be employed in various ways in the
process of evolutionary optimization, e.g. analyzing the evolutionary behaviors, learning the appropriate operators, 
reducing the evaluations, transferring knowledges from similar problems, and so on. Motivated by this, we are organizing a
workshop around Evolutionary Optimization and Learning collocated with the 15th Pacific Rim International Conference on 
Artificial Intelligence August 27-31, 2018, Nanjing, China. The workshop will feature several keynote talks by leading
experts on this topic and related fields.Â
